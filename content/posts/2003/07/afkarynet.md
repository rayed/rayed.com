<p>I know it has been long time since the last update to the website, I was very lasy lately.</p>
<p>The part were I wasn&#8217;t lazy I work in a new site called <a href="http://www.afkary.net/">afkary.net</a>, Afkary means &#8220;My Ideas&#8221;, no it doesn&#8217;t talk about my own ideas, it will be service to allow users to create their own eMagazine, without the need to install any software, just take the sample site, and customize it to your taste.<br />Still working on it to make it really easy, and useful.</p>
<p>During the work on afkary I found out about <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org/">MoveableType.org</a> it is a free weblog software, very nice, I might install it on my server someday instead of the own I built my self.</p>
