<p>When Microsoft released Bing search engine, I was really impressed, it looks good and the search is good.</p>
<p>But unfortunately Microsoft have a very bad habits of ruining really good products.</p>
<p>When you try to search for <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=Why+is+Windows+so+expensive%3F&#038;form=QBRE&#038;qs=n">Why is Windows so expensive?</a>, the first result you will get is: &#8220;Why are Mac&#8217;s So Expensive?&#8221;</p>
