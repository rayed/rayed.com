When Microsoft released Bing search engine, I was really impressed, it looks good and the search is good.

But unfortunately Microsoft have a very bad habits of ruining really good products.

When you try to search for <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=Why+is+Windows+so+expensive%3F&#038;form=QBRE&#038;qs=n">Why is Windows so expensive?</a>, the first result you will get is: "Why are Mac's So Expensive?"
