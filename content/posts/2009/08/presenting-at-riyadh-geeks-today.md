Today at 7:15 pm Riyadh time, I am going to give a presentation titled "Tips for faster websites" in front of  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=38193262698">Riyadh Geeks</a> group at <a href="http://www.badirict.com.sa/">Bader</a>.

Alriyadh Newspaper covered the meeting and the presentation:

**Update:**

We've just finished Riyadh Geeks meeting, big audience, thank you all for coming, and special thank to "Riyadh Geeks" for inventing me, and arranging this event.
