<p>Have you ever asked your self where does Google buy its servers, Dell, HP, IBM, or Sun?</p>
<p>Unlike everyone in the world, Google don&#8217;t buy servers from different vendor they build them!</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t make sense if you have 100 or 1000 servers, but if what about if you have hundreds of thousands of servers, which is the case for Google.</p>
<p>Actually Google have long time ago stated that they their own server, but the company revealed many new details about its servers, and operation.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each server has its own battery. (reason check next item)</li>
<li>No UPS in the data center. (reason check previous item)</li>
<li>The unit of the data center is a container, not a server, and not a rack, but a whole container. (Sun sell something like too).</li>
<li>x86 because it is cheap.</li>
</ul>
