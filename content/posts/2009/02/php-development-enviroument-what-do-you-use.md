<p>I must confess, I still use <a href="http://www.chami.com/html-kit/">HTML-kit</a> for PHP development, the only reason I use it for direct FTP editing, I know I should be ashamed of my self üôÅ</p>
<p>The last couple of months I started to look at <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> version control system, as a secure and professional way to edit your code, so I started shopping for new PHP IDE.</p>
<p>My requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support Arabic</li>
<li>Support UTF-8</li>
<li>Support Subversion</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do you use for PHP development? and what feature is a must?</p>
<p>BTW, Smashing Magazine published an article covering this subject, this why I am testing NetBeans at the moment.<br />
