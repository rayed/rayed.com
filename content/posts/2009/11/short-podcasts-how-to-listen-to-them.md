I own an iPod for more than three years now, and since I am not a music fan it was setting in my drawer doing nothing, the only useful thing I used it for was putting some kids shows for my son to keep him busy during long journeys.</p>
<p>But recently I discovered the wonderful world of Podcasts, and to be honest I got addicted to it, these days you will often see me with my earbuds walking like a zombie.</p>
<p>I especially enjoy listening to the podcasts in the car, I am a bad tempered driver who focus too much on the road, and podcasts help me loosen up and relax.</p>
<p>If you listen to podcast in the car like me you will face a problem of listening to short podcasts, many great podcasts are few minutes long, and changing them while driving is really a bad option, and iPod don&#8217;t have a way to listen to all episodes in a podcast by default.</p>
<p>Of course you could create a playlist in iTunes and add all episodes to it, then you could play a playlist from your iPod, but what will happen when you download new episodes!</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong><br />
The solution is actually very straight forward and simple, instead of creating a &#8220;playlist&#8221; create a new &#8220;Smart Playlist&#8221;, no it isn&#8217;t a word I just invented it is an actual feature in iTunes, just click &#8220;File > New Smart Playlist &#8230;&#8221; (CTRL+ALT+N), a popup window will open add the desired criteria, e.g. Album contains &#8220;60-Second Science&#8221;, make sure you check &#8220;Live updating&#8221; to keep the list fresh when new episodes are downloaded.</p>
