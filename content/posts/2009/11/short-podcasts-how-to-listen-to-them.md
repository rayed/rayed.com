I own an iPod for more than three years now, and since I am not a music fan it was setting in my drawer doing nothing, the only useful thing I used it for was putting some kids shows for my son to keep him busy during long journeys.

But recently I discovered the wonderful world of Podcasts, and to be honest I got addicted to it, these days you will often see me with my earbuds walking like a zombie.

I especially enjoy listening to the podcasts in the car, I am a bad tempered driver who focus too much on the road, and podcasts help me loosen up and relax.

If you listen to podcast in the car like me you will face a problem of listening to short podcasts, many great podcasts are few minutes long, and changing them while driving is really a bad option, and iPod don't have a way to listen to all episodes in a podcast by default.

Of course you could create a playlist in iTunes and add all episodes to it, then you could play a playlist from your iPod, but what will happen when you download new episodes!

**Solution**

The solution is actually very straight forward and simple, instead of creating a "playlist" create a new "Smart Playlist", no it isn't a word I just invented it is an actual feature in iTunes, just click "File > New Smart Playlist ..." (CTRL+ALT+N), a popup window will open add the desired criteria, e.g. Album contains "60-Second Science", make sure you check "Live updating" to keep the list fresh when new episodes are downloaded.
