<p>If you build Arabic website you must be hit by the hard reality, Arabic web font options are really narrow, the only realistic choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tahoma: only good for small sizes.</li>
<li>Arabic Transparent</li>
<li>Traditional Arabic</li>
</ul>
<p>My idea is to buy other quality Arabic fonts and ask browser/OS vendors to include them, we really need more choice to improve the quality of website productions, and add more creativity to our Arabic Internet.</p>
<p>The idea came after I read something from <a href="http://twitter.com/jalammar">Jihad Alammar</a>, and <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2009/05/23/web-fonts-now-how-were-doing-with-that/">Web fonts now (how weâ€™re doing with that)</a></p>
<p>If you have an ideas to improve the initial idea please comment.</p>
