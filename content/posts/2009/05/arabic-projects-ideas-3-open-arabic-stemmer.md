<p>Nowadays we have many great options to build your own search engines, either for your website, or for you own custom applications. to mention a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/">Lucene</a>
</li>
<li><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> (uses Lucene)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com/">Sphinx</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these search engine option works great for English language, and they have decent support for Arabic language thanks  to Unicode and UTF-8, but unfortunately they still lack a the power of stemming that you will find in English language.</p>
<blockquote><p>Stemming is the process for reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their stem, base or root form â€“ generally a written word form. The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming</a></p>
<p>The idea is to build open stem engine for Arabic language, and port to different computer languages: C, C++, Java, C#, etc&#8230; so it can be easily used in all Arabic information retentival systems. </p>
<p>If you have an ideas to improve the initial idea please comment.</p>
