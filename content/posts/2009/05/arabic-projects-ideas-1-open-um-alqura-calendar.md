<p>In Saudi Arabia the official calendar is Um Alqura calendar, which is a Hejeri based calendar.<br />
The idea is to buy the royalties of the calculation function (KACST owns it), and open it, and force all software vendors to include it.<br />
Just imagine that your mobile date, match your outlook date, match your favourite website date. Stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Government: KACST, CITC, Yesser, MCIT</li>
<li>Software vendors: Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, Sun, Apple</li>
<li>Open Source: Linux, MySQL, Postgresql etc..</li>
<li>Mobile phones vendors: Nokia, SonyEriccson, Apple, HTC, etc&#8230;</li>
<li>Other electronics vendors: Humax receiver manufacturer.</li>
<li>Content Providers: Google, Maktoob, Yahoo, MSN, Newspapers, etc..</li>
<li>Development Languages: Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Perl, etc&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an ideas to improve the initial idea please comment.</p>
