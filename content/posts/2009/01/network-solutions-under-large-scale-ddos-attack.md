I got a DNS failure when I tried to access my website yesterday, I didn't suspect my ISP because I am using <a href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a> as my name server, so I switched back to SAUDI NET name servers and it worked fine. So I thought it was OpenDNS problem, until I read the news about large-scale DDoS attack on Network Solutions my DNS registrar, where I also host my DNS for rayed.com.
