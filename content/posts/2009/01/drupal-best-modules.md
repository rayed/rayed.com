<p>One of <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">Drupal&#8217;s</a> best features is the modular design, the core of Drupal is very small but flexible, and it only implements basic functionality.</p>
<p>The good news is that Drupal already has hundreds of modules to implement any missing feature, you can even build your own module if you didn&#8217;t find a module to fulfill your needs.</p>
<p>But having all these choices make finding the appropriate module a really hard job, to help you select the best Drupal modules I found a good list of module at <a href="http://acquia.com/">Acquia</a> (a commercial company founded by Drupal inventor Dries Buytaert to provide different services around Drupal).</p>
<p>Acquia currently support these module:<br />
