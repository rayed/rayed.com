<p>jQuery is a lightweight Javascript library, it is very easy to learn, I found this amazing video from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/googletechtalks">Google TechTalk</a> channel on Youtube, don&#8217;t be fooled by the presenter age (he is 12 years old) he knows what is he talking about, enjoy!<br />
