<blockquote><p><strong>Overall Grade:</strong> Very High Risk Location<br />
<strong>Severe Problems:</strong> Political Violence &#038; Repression, Political &#038; Social Environment<br />
<strong>Major Problem:</strong> Culture &#038; Recreation Facilities<br />
<strong>Other Problems:</strong> Housing, Climate, Disease &#038; Sanitation, Education Facilities, Physical Remoteness, Communications</p>
<p>No surprise here. Life in the Saudi capital is not easy. &#8220;The possibility of a terrorist attack is an ongoing threat,&#8221; according to ORC, &#8220;while wide-ranging restrictions on dress, movement, conduct, food, alcohol, travel, and communications limit expatriate life.&#8221; The city is especially hard for foreign women. Finally, adds ORC, &#8220;violating the country&#8217;s strict moral religious codes is a particular danger in this conservative city.&#8221;
