<blockquote><p>Ericsson has successfully demonstrated data-transfer speeds of more than 500 megabits per second over copper, the communications company said Monday.</p>
<p>The data-transfer rates were achieved using a version of digital subscriber line (DSL) technology called &#8220;vectorized&#8221; VDSL2, Ericsson said in a statement. The technology, also called &#8220;crosstalk cancellation,&#8221; provides the high transmission rates through a twisted pair of copper cables by reducing the noise coming from other pairs in the same cable bundle. VDSL2 has traditionally offered speeds of around 100Mbps. </p></blockquote>
<p>I will be happy if my DSL line give me 512K, I am even afraid to upgrade and lose it all üôÅ</p>
