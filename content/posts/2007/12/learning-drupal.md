<p>Every Eid vacation I end up with an extra free time, I usually use it to learn new stuff, the latest vacation I decided to learn <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. Drupal is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">Content management system</a> (CMS), it is basically a software to help you manage your content.</p>
<p>Drupal is a modular and customizable CMS, you can use it to build different types of web sites, a Blog, company or organization web site, community website, you name it.</p>
<p>Since last year <a href="http://blog.ibraq.com/">Abdullah Aldosari</a> start working with Drupal, and as always he started marketing it as the best invention ever, and as always I argued with him that building your own CMS is better, and as always I was wrong ðŸ™‚ Drupal is the best invention ever!! okay I am bit exaggerating but please don&#8217;t do my mistake, if you are building a new website find your self a CMS and customize it.</p>
<p>Customizing a CMS isn&#8217;t that hard, it would be much easier than building everything from scratch, and it will give you many features that you didn&#8217;t even think of. <a href="http://drupal.org/features">Drupal Features</a></p>
<p>Of course you don&#8217;t have to use CMS for every website you build, in many situations it is better to build your own stuff or use a framework instead of CMS. Check <a href="http://drupal.org/handbook/is-drupal-right-for-you">Is Drupal right for you</a> to help you decide ðŸ™‚</p>
