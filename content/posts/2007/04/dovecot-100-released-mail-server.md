<p><a href="http://www.dovecot.org/">Dovecot</a> version 1.0.0 finally released, after almost 5 years of development.</p>
<p>Dovecot is IMAP and POP3 server, it is one of the best and easiest servers I ever worked with, easy enough for home environment, and flexible and powerful enough for service providers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tested it earlier before and hopefully we will migrate to it later this year.</p>
<p>Dovecot integrate very well with Postfix mail server (Postfix handle SMTP, Dovecot handle POP3+IMAP), and can easily support virtual hosting.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more articles about Dovecot to come.</p>
