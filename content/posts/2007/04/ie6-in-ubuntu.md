<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> Linux is really easy OS with many interesting features, one of the best sites to help you with your Ubuntu experince is <a href="http://ubuntuguide.org/">Ubuntu Guide</a>, the site has many useful tips on how to do thing in Ubuntu.

One of the tips is <a href="http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Edgy#How_to_install_Internet_Explorer_.2B_Flash_9_.28IEs4Linux.29">how to install Internet Explorer under Ubuntu</a>, I saw <a href="http://fahadblog.com/">Fahad AlShenaifi</a> do it, he is our Ubuntu expert since he is using it exclusively for the past year or so.

So I decided to give it a try, 5 minutes later I have IE6 on my machine ðŸ™‚  (I have fast link so your mileage may vary)
