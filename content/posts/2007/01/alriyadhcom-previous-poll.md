<p>Recently I have improved <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/">alriyadh.com</a> voting system, many of them are in administration area, some of these changes will be visible in the near future.</p>
<p>One of the new additions is the previous votes page:<br />
<a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/php/vote/">http://www.alriyadh.com/php/vote/</a></p>
<p>Check it out, and keep in mind the design is still under work.</p>
<p>Memo to self: replace the word &#8220;vote&#8221; with &#8220;poll&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> If you see weird colors in IE (7?) it is fixed now.</p>
