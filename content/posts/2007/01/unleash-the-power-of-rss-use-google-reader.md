<p>Few weeks ago I started using <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>, and so far it is amazing. Basically you subscribe all your RSS feeds you are interested in Google Reader, and instead of visiting 10 or 20 website, you visit Reader page to get the latest updates.</p>
<p>The integration with Firefox is amazing, just click on RSS icon and you can add it directly to Google Reader, very easy.</p>
<p>I used to use Thunderbird for a while for RSS, but after I set it up I forgot to use it. The subscription method is bit more complex than Google reader, and lack of a single folder for all of my RSS feeds make it useless.</p>
<p>What do you use to read RSS?</p>
