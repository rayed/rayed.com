<p><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> my favorite operating system has new version 6.2. The new version has many features, the most intersting (for me at least):</p>
<ul>
<li>freebsd-update provides officially supported binary updates for security fixes and errata patches (I always thought applying the patches manually isn&#8217;t friendly enough for most people).</li>
<li>csup, an integrated cvsup client  (Now I don&#8217;t have to install it manually in new machines).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you never used FreeBSD invest sometime on it, and I guarantee that you will fall in love with it ðŸ™‚</p>
