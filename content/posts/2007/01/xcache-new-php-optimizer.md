<p><a href="http://trac.lighttpd.net/xcache/">XCache</a> is relatively new PHP code optimizer, written by &#8220;Jan Kneschke&#8221; the same guy who wrote <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">Lighttpd</a> web server.</p>
<p>After migrating <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/">Alriyadh.com</a> to the new dual CPU servers, I had problems with APC PHP optimizer and locking, so I disabled the optimizer altogether, after all the CPU was very fast and it handled the load without any problems.</p>
<p>But lately with my increasing interest on Lighttpd I noticed XCache, I never heard of it before but after reading the web site, and the problem APC have with multi processors I decided to give XCache a try, and the best of all it was ready in <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> ports, so I installed it and so far it doing a good job.</p>
<p>My initial tests shows 400% improvement. Thanks Jan.</p>
