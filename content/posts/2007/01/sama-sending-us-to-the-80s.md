<p><a href="http://www.sama.gov.sa/">Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA)</a> lately is doing a horrible job with SPAN network, SPAN is Saudi Arabia system for paying using your bank card.</p>
<p>In the last 4 months, most transactions from local store fails, which force many business and customer to fall back to an older technology, Cash!!</p>
<p>I am not used to carrying a lot of cash with me, and rely on my bank card to buy goods.</p>
<p>To make things worst some of the failed transactions, get charged to your account, and you have to file a complaint to your bank to get the money back. This is not the worst part, I filed one since 8th of October and until now I didn&#8217;t get any reply from my bank, they claim it is SAMA again doesn&#8217;t reply to the request yet.</p>
<p>Is it my luck or SAMA is actually sending us to the 80s?</p>
