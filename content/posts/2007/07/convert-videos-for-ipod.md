<p>My son Abdullah is addicted to <a href="http://www.nickjr.co.uk/shows/dora/index.aspx">Dora the Explorer</a> cartoons, and since I am planing to travel in the summer I am looking for ways to take his DVDs with me using my iPod.</p>
<p>I found this free software that convert videos to iPod ready format, so far it is doing very good job.<br />
