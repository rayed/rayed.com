The last computer game I spent more than 1 hour playing was <a href="http://www.crashbandicoot.com/">Crash Bandicoot</a> on Sony play station 1, after this game I lost interest on all computer games, I even started to hate them specially football related game (e.g. Winning Eleven), for some reason I couldn't train my self to hit the sequence square-square-triangle to do whatever it do in PS.

Few months ago I read about <a href="http://www.wii.com/">Nintendo Wii</a> and it is new revolutionary controller, the Wii remote, it is basically a game controller that you wave in the space and can detect 3D motion. You can use Wii remote as a sword, baseball bat, tennis racquet, human hand, you name it.

After the school end my brother Khalid got a Wii gift, we installed it and start playing with, and it is amazing!!

First of all it is really funny to watch people playing with the Wii remote and get excited and jump around like crazy monkeys, I didn't saw it but I was told I was like that :), second you play it with all your body not only your poor fingers.

Up to 4 players can play together, all you need is a big room, and a big screen and large group of people, and of course wear a training suit because believe me you will sweat a lot.
