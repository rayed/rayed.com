<p>This week, I started my new job at <a href="http://www.citc.gov.sa/">CITC</a>, I am leaving <a href="http://www.stc.com.sa">STC</a>, I&#8217;ve spent the last 6 years working for SAUDI NET and SAUDI DATA.</p>
<p>Alhamdu Lelah, the last 6 years were amazing, I learned too many thing, made friends with too many people.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone participated in this great experience, and special thank to Abdullah Aldosari who add the extra spices on it ðŸ˜‰</p>
