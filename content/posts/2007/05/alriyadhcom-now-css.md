<p><strong>Warning: It is the same design converted to CSS.</strong></p>
<p>After 5 weeks of development and testing, <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/">Alriyadh.com</a> is now converted to CSS based design, it still not 100% complete.</p>
<p>You can view the design by using this URL:<br />
<a href="http://www2.alriyadh.com/">www2.alriyadh.com</a></p>
<p>Some benefits of moving to CSS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts look the same a cross browsers: I am using <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo! User Interface Library</a> fonts file to guarantee that font have the same size a cross browsers.</li>
<li>Page are bit smaller: because many presentation tags are now removed from the HMTL and put in the CSS.</li>
<li>Printer friendly by default: we now have have separate CSS file for printing, so no need for printer friendly page since all page are automatically are.</li>
<li>PDA friendly by default: same as printer CSS, not implemented yet.</li>
<li>Rendering is faster.</li>
<li>It will simplify future redesign. (since we are talking about redesign, suggestion are welcomed ðŸ™‚ )</li>
</ul>
