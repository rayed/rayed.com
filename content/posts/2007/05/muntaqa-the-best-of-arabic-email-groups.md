Today me and <a href="http://blog.ibraq.com/">Abdullah</a> launched <a href="http://www.muntaqa.com/">Muntaqa</a>.</p>
<p>Muntaqa is a website that collect large number of email groups, e.g. <a href="http://www.abunawaf.com/">AbuNawaf</a>, and displays them in a single page, people can vote, bookmark, and comment on all emails.</p>
<p>In the front page you will get the most popular emails, so you want miss any interesting emails in the Arabic web sphere ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Muntaqa works like <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a>, but instead of submitting websites, we automatically submit emails from email groups. A big population of computer users in Arab world (at least in Saudi Arabia) still consider the emails as the only form of publishing in the Internet.</p>
<p>Emails are viewed in their original form with all the ads in the original email, we don&#8217;t want to hurt group owners business.</p>
