<p>Without any announcement Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (<a href="http://www.sama.gov.sa/">SAMA</a>) released the new 1/2 Riyal, it replaces the old coin, with special technologically advanced features, like UOO (Use Only Once), and WCAC (Who Cares About Consumers)</p>

<p>Seriously SAMA I am sick of shops handing me a chewing gum instead of 1/2 Riyal, and you have to do something about it, my suggestions (some of them not related to SAMA):</p>
<ul>
<li>Invent new paper 1/2 Riyal</li>
<li>Replace the paper 1 Riyal, with a coin only version so people and shops force to use coins.</li>
<li>Force shops to have &#8220;charity&#8221; chewing gum, it could be piece of paper not real gum, so when you buy it, benefits directed to charities.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Calculations:</b><br />
Number of transactions in a super market per day: 4000<br />
Number of transactions with chewing gum: 2000<br />
Charity chewing gum value: 1000 SR<br />
Charity chewing gum value per year : <big>365,000 SR</big></p>
<p><b>UPDATE:</b><br />
