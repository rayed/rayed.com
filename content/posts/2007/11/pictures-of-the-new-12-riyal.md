Without any announcement Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (<a href="http://www.sama.gov.sa/">SAMA</a>) released the new 1/2 Riyal, it replaces the old coin, with special technologically advanced features, like UOO (Use Only Once), and WCAC (Who Cares About Consumers)

Seriously SAMA I am sick of shops handing me a chewing gum instead of 1/2 Riyal, and you have to do something about it, my suggestions (some of them not related to SAMA):

- Invent new paper 1/2 Riyal
- Replace the paper 1 Riyal, with a coin only version so people and shops force to use coins.
- Force shops to have "charity" chewing gum, it could be piece of paper not real gum, so when you buy it, benefits directed to charities.

**Calculations:**

- Number of transactions in a super market per day: 4000
- Number of transactions with chewing gum: 2000
- Charity chewing gum value: 1000 SR
- Charity chewing gum value per year : <big>365,000 SR</big>


**UPDATE:**

Mr. Saleh Alshehe wrote an <a href="http://www.alwatan.com.sa/news/writerdetail.asp?issueno=2595&#038;id=2955&#038;Rname=37">article</a> in Alwatan newspaper talking about the same issue.
