<p>After serving <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/">Alriyadh.com</a> the past 3 years, I am replacing <a href="http://swish-e.org/">Swish-e</a> with <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> search server, Solr is a search server based on <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/">Lucene</a> text search engine.</p>
<p><img src='http://rayed.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/lucene_green_150.gif' alt='Lucene' align="right"   /></p>
<p>Solr has many advance features I didn&#8217;t utilize most of them yet, but hopefully you will see them soon. I will write a post about Solr and how it works and its integrate with PHP soon.</p>
<p>For now please have a look at it and tell me what you think.</p>
