<p>Inpired by <a href="http://colorspretty.blogspot.com/2007/01/flickrs-dirty-little-secre_117020899505299548.html">Flickr&#8217;s Dirty Little Secret</a> post, about how <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> thumbnails make the photo prettier than the original photo.</p>
<p>The article suggest that Flick sharpen the image before it resize it.</p>
<p>So I did my own test, this the result and you are the judge:<br />
<img src="/upload/2007-02-05/img-small.jpg" /> <img src="/upload/2007-02-05/img-med.jpg" /></p>
<p>Image 1, normal resize.<br />
Image 2, sharpen before resize.</p>
<p><img src="/upload/2007-02-05/img2.jpg" /></p>
<p><img src="/upload/2007-02-05/img2-sharp.jpg" /></p>
<p>Sharpened and saturated +100:<br />
<img src="/upload/2007-02-05/img2-sharp-sat.jpg" /></p>
<p>All I need to know is how to do it from inside PHP.</p>
