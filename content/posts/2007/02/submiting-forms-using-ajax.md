When you build AJAX based form, you need to provide visual feedback to tell the user that something is really happening.

I created small template for this purpose:

<a href="/static/uploads/old/2007-02-07/ajax.html">

<img src="/static/uploads/old/2007-02-07/ajax.gif" alt="" border="0" />

Ajax Form</a>

Hopefully you will see it in the next <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/">alriyadh.com</a> CSS based theme ðŸ™‚
