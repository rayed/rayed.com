<p>When you build AJAX based form, you need to provide visual feedback to tell the user that something is really happening.</p>
<p>I created small template for this purpose:<br />
<a href="/upload/2007-02-07/ajax.html"><br />
<img src="/upload/2007-02-07/ajax.gif" alt="" border="0" /><br />
Ajax Form</a></p>
<p>Hopefully you will see it in the next <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/">alriyadh.com</a> CSS based theme ðŸ™‚</p>
