Few months ago I went to <a href="http://www.fuddruckers.com/">Fuddruckers</a> restaurant, and I ordered grilled chicken salad, I am not a salad guy and the salad tasted bit plane, so I went to the sauce bar and took the most exotic looking sauce, I grabber <a href="http://www.cholula.com/">Cholula</a> hot sauce with its distinct large round wooden cap and tried it with my salad, the flavor was amazing. I even took a picture of the sauce trying to find it in local stores.

Unfortunately I couldn't find it anywhere, so I contact Cholula company ask for local distribute here in Riyadh. If you spotted the sauce please let me know!
