<p>Two weeks ago I visited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah">Jeddah</a> city for the first time since 1990, yes 17 years since my last visit!</p>
<p>I made my flight reservation on <a href="http://www.saudiairlines.com/">Saudi Airlines</a>, and the only return flight I found was on Friday 7am, and since the flight is so early it will ruin my Thursday too, I decided to try the new economical air lines, <a href="http://flysama.com/">Sama</a> or <a href="http://www.flynas.com/">Nas</a>.</p>
<p>I visited the two sites, and I made my decision on how good the website was.</p>
<p>I favored Sama, so I made a reservation and found an alternative return flight at 6:50 pm, the flight cost me 840 SR (2 tickets), 300 SR less than Saudi Airline. But I ended up paying an extra 100 SR for missing my flight and rescheduling another one (50 SR per ticket).</p>
<p>The plane was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737">Boeing 737</a>, it was small but suitable for short journeys, the seat are leather without any extras, the plane was overall clean. Of course no free meals or snacks, but you can buy overpriced sandwiches.</p>
<p>What I love most is the ease of making the reservation, and paying. I tried to pay using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SADAD">Sadad</a> system using my bank website, but it didn&#8217;t work, so I ended up paying using my credit card, but even with this change it was easier than Saudi Airlines.</p>
<p>The only thing I hate was the crowded sales line, Sama get more staff in the airport and you will be perfect.</p>
