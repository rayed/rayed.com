Last week my friend Osama Aldosary was cleaning his emails and found this **13 years old** email from me back when I was working as a system admin at <a href="http://www.kacst.edu.sa/ar/depts/isu/Pages/Home.aspx">ISU KACST</a>, and I was administrating the email servers that accept and forward all internet emails for Saudi universities, Osama was working for KSU back then.

Thank you Osama

    Salam Brothers,

    As you all know KACST was connected through King Faisal Specializes
    Hospital, and since KACST is now connected through ISU, we have to
    replace our old IP addresses with the new ones from ISU.

    Of course this will affect the leased-line link and E-Mail traffic with
    all of you, and we tried to delay the migration as much as we can to
    give you enough time to set up your own services through ISU link.

    Our dead line to return the old IPs will end in less than a month, then
    we have to return them to RIPE, we are going to start our plan to
    migrate to the new IPs, and we have to stop the leased-line link and our
    old mail relay that serve your domains when we return the old IPs.

    I am sure that most of you are ready by now, but if you are facing any
    problems we will be happy to help you with it.

    NOTE:
    Please send me the current state of your migration plan, and the
    estimated time to finish.
