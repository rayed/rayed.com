<p>Last week my friend Osama Aldosary was cleaning his emails and found this <strong>13 years old</strong> email from me back when I was working as a system admin at <a href="http://www.kacst.edu.sa/ar/depts/isu/Pages/Home.aspx">ISU KACST</a>, and I was administrating the email servers that accept and forward all internet emails for Saudi universities, Osama was working for KSU back then.</p>
<p>Thank you Osama</p>

Subject:	New Link Migration Plan<br />

<p>Salam Brothers,</p>
<p>As you all know KACST was connected through King Faisal Specializes<br />
Hospital, and since KACST is now connected through ISU, we have to<br />
replace our old IP addresses with the new ones from ISU.</p>
<p>Of course this will affect the leased-line link and E-Mail traffic with<br />
all of you, and we tried to delay the migration as much as we can to<br />
give you enough time to set up your own services through ISU link.</p>
<p>Our dead line to return the old IPs will end in less than a month, then<br />
we have to return them to RIPE, we are going to start our plan to<br />
migrate to the new IPs, and we have to stop the leased-line link and our<br />
old mail relay that serve your domains when we return the old IPs.</p>
<p>I am sure that most of you are ready by now, but if you are facing any<br />
problems we will be happy to help you with it.</p>
<p>NOTE:<br />
Please send me the current state of your migration plan, and the<br />
estimated time to finish.</p>
