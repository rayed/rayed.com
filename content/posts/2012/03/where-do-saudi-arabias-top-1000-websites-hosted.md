<p>Small report I worked on to find out the hosting location of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s top accessed websites, the aim of this report is to raise the awareness of the lack of Internet hosting in Saudi Arabia, and the slow adoption of Saudi TLD &#8220;.sa&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Short summary only 8.9% of sites are hosted locally, and only 4.9% have &#8220;.sa&#8221; domain.</strong></p>
