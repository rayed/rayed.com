Small report I worked on to find out the hosting location of Saudi Arabia's top accessed websites, the aim of this report is to raise the awareness of the lack of Internet hosting in Saudi Arabia, and the slow adoption of Saudi TLD ".sa".

<a href="/static/uploads/2012/03/hosting.png"><img src="/static/uploads/2012/03/hosting.png" alt="" title="hosting" width="466" height="288" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-907" srcset="/static/uploads/2012/03/hosting.png 466w, /static/uploads/2012/03/hosting-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px" /></a>

**Short summary only 8.9% of sites are hosted locally, and only 4.9% have ".sa" domain.**

Please have a look and tell me how can I improve it.
