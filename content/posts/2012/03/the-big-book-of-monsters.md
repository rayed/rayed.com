<p>Few months ago while waiting for our flight in the airport I took out my notebook (paper one) and I start drawing with my son Dody, we started drawing different monsters trying to be funny and creative, and we decided to write a book with the name &#8220;The Big Book of Monsters&#8221; where we fill it with drawings of monsters with names and describing their powers.</p>
