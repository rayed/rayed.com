Few months ago while waiting for our flight in the airport I took out my notebook (paper one) and I start drawing with my son Dody, we started drawing different monsters trying to be funny and creative, and we decided to write a book with the name "The Big Book of Monsters" where we fill it with drawings of monsters with names and describing their powers.

So here some sample pages:

Hope you enjoy it!

If you have an idea for a monster and you want me to draw please leave a comment, or if you have other ideas for father and son activity/book let me know ðŸ™‚
