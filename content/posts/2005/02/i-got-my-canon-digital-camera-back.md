<p>Finally after two months with the Quershi service center I got my Canon digital camera back.<br />I tried to call them for the past couple of weeks and no one answers, so I had to go to the shop my self, and surprise! Surprise! the shop is closed they moved to another location, so I went to the new location and took my camera, I wonder why they didn&#8217;t call me to tell me that the camera is ready.<br />BTW, they took 235 to fix the dark LCD screen for the camera, they said there were an oil on the LCD which ruined it!!! and it isn&#8217;t covered by the warranty.<br />I hope I&#8217;ll live until I see real warranty in Saudi Arabia, they always says it isn&#8217;t covered by the warranty !</p>
