<p>Now you can use SAUDI NET EasyNet without any proxy settings, we knew that transparent HTTP works fine for a long time, unfortunately we didn&#8217;t know that transparent HTTPS could work too, this is why we waited until this time when we saw one of the ISP implemented it üôÅ<br />Any way it is working fine now, so if you want to use SAUDI NET EasyNet just:</p>
<ul>
<li> Call <b><nobr>3 66 00 77</nobr></b> </li>
<p></p>
<li>Without username</li>
<p></p>
<li>Without Password</li>
<p></p>
<li>Without Proxy settings</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy it.</p>
