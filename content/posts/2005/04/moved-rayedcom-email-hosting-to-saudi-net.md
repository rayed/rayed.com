<p>Finally I moved my domain rayed.com email hosting to SAUDI NET, the main reason is that old server was very unreliable and was down for 5 days, the old server was very old Compaq PC Pentium III with all disk almost full, it was shared with the great site <a href="http://www.fqaqee3.net">Fqaqee3.net</a>, Misfer the owner of fqaqee3.net is little busy these days, I hope he could rearrange the server and move it better server.</p>
