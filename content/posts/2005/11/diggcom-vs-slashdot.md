<p>If you like <a href="http://slashdot.org/">SlashDot</a> the technical news site, you will love <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a>.</p>
<p>My first impression of digg is that Digg has more links, and less discussion.</p>
<p>The major advantage about Digg is that stories are picked by users not by ad editor, which makes it self maintained site! check Digg <a href="http://digg.com/faq">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>There is even a dedicated website to compare Digg to Slashdot, and give score to based on how fast they post a news, so far the result Digg 24, Slashdot 14:<br />
