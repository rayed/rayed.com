<p>Everyday at 11pm, alriyadh.com team start working on the next day issue, the job involve copying all contents from the printed version to the alriyadh.com content management system, the process involve 2 to 3 team members, and takes about 4-5 hours to complete.</p>
<p>But last Thursday was a special case, due to a planned vacation for one team member, and family issues for another member, Faisal Alenzi was the only guy working that night and he carried the whole show and published the whole issue on time by him self.</p>
<p>Great job Faisal ðŸ™‚</p>
