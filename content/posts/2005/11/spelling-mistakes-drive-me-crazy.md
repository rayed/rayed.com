<p>I am not a &#8220;speeling bee champion&#8221; -the previous sentence proves it ðŸ™‚  -, and I usually don&#8217;t care about spelling mistakes of others, but some spelling mistakes drive me crazy.</p>
<p>One of the most common in Arabic is:<br />
Ù„Ø§ÙƒÙ†<br />
This is wrong, if you write it like this please stop, it is written:<br />
Ù„ÙƒÙ†</p>
<p>I hope Google would support Arabic in their toolbar spell checker.</p>
<p>P.S: If you noticed any spelling mistakes in any of my post please let me know.<br />
P.S: I used to write &#8220;great&#8221; as &#8220;grate&#8221; for many many years, but thanks to my friend &#8220;Fayez Alazmi&#8221; who corrected me one day I don&#8217;t write &#8220;grate&#8221; that often any more ðŸ™‚ .</p>
