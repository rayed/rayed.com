<p><a href="http://www.isu.net.sa/">ISU</a> blocked <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> for the third time in less than a year, I HATE YOU ISU.</p>
<p>Please help me to unblock Flickr by filing <a href="http://www.isu.net.sa/saudi-internet/contenet-filtring/forms/unblock-requist-ar.htm">URL unblocking request</a>.</p>
<p>The importance of flickr is that thousands of weblogs and personal websites host their image at flickr, so by blocking flickr they blocked all images from all of these weblogs.</p>
