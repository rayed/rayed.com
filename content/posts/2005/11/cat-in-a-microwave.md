<p>This a very disturbing story, I don&#8217;t recommend reading it at all, or at least don&#8217;t try to visualize the story.</p>
<p>A family left their 3 kids, oldest is 8, at home with the family maid, they were playing in the garden with a small kitten they have, while playing it rained and the kitten got wet, so the kids thought they need to dry her, so they put her in the microwave and they clicked random numbers and started cooking the poor kitten, after few minutes the microwave exploded and the kitten internal part shattered all over the kitchen.</p>
<p>When the mother came back and saw all the blood in the kitchen she thought something bad happened to the kids, and after she checked all of them and learned what happened she decided to replace the whole kitchen.</p>
<p>The moral of the story, the kitchen is very dangerous place to be, specially for kids, so make sure your kids stay away from it.</p>
