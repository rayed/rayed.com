Alriyadh.com introduced new style to display comments, see the <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/2005/11/08/article106434.html">Sample Article</a>

The new style uses CSS instead of tables, which make it much smaller and cleaner.

A link to each comment is also added -the time of the post- to allow bookmarking and sending URLs to specific comment.

The posting form is now viewed in the same page, it is hidden by default but after clicking "Post Comment" it will appear thank to the power of Javascript.

Inspiration of the new list came from the following sites (Thanks ðŸ™‚ ) :
