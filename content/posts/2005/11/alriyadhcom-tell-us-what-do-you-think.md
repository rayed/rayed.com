<p>Today <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/">Alriyadh.com</a> opened comments on all articles, instead of articles in the &#8220;columns&#8221; section only.</p>
<p>In the first day of opening comments the amount of comments posted today tripled the average daily volume.</p>
<p>This means the work on the Internet team will need to work three times harder than they used to be, since all of user comments need to be moderated!</p>
<p>This is a huge step from being just an electronic copy of the printed newspaper, to becoming a real Internet website.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will see the day where Alriyadh.com compete with the printed newspaper.</p>
