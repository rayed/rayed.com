<p>I <a href="http://rayed.com/wordpress/?p=149">worte</a> a while back about JVC camcorder with harddisk, I bought this camera to shoot my baby life ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>I thought I would write small review about it, so here is the good and the bad.</p>
<p>The good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use.</li>
<li>No tapes to buy, to take on trips, to exchange, just take the shoot.</li>
<li>No over writing other clips by mistake.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bad:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less than average video quality.</li>
<li>I have an old notebook with USB1, moving clips from the camcorder to notebook takes very very long time.</li>
</ul>
