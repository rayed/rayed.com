I [wrote](/posts/2005/10/jvc-camcorders-with-hard-disk/) a while back about JVC camcorder with hard disk, I bought this camera to shoot my baby life ðŸ™‚

I thought I would write small review about it, so here is the good and the bad.

The good:

- Easy to use.
- No tapes to buy, to take on trips, to exchange, just take the shoot.
- No over writing other clips by mistake.


The bad:

- Less than average video quality.
- I have an old notebook with USB1, moving clips from the camcorder to notebook takes very very long time.
