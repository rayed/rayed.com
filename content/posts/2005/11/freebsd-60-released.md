<p>My web server is running FreeBSD 5.3 for the past 100 days without any problems. But 5.X isn&#8217;t as and fast as 4.X series, hope this will change with the new 6.0 release.</p>
<p>Some major improvment over 5.4:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significant performance improvements to the filesystem and direct disk access layers of the OS.  The filesystem is now multithreaded and can take full advantage of multiple CPU systems.</li>
<li>Expanded support for wireless networking adapters and new support for the WPA wireless security protocol.</li>
<li>Experimental support for the PowerPC platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Slashdot covered the <a href="http://bsd.slashdot.org/bsd/05/11/04/1539240.shtml?tid=162&#038;tid=7">story</a>, and most of the feedback from FreeBSD 6.0 beta users was positive:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Whereas 5.x was about introducing the new architecture, 6.x is all about making it blindingly fast and stable.
</p></blockquote>
