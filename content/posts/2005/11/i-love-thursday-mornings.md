<p>The best time of the week by far is Thursday morning, I usually wake up around 8 am, even when I stay late the night before it, I go out for breakfast at any place quite.</p>
<p>Today I went to MyPie restaurant in Olaya, it is a small restaurant that serve Pies of course and sandwiches. I usually take Labna with Tomato, and Meat pies, but today I tried the lever sandwich (very popular in Saudi), and Shakshokah (Scrambled eggs with tomato and onion).</p>
<p>The thing that attract me to MyPie is the food of course, and most importantly is the fact that it has just the right a mount of people, usually you will find two to four people max, so you don&#8217;t feel lonely and not in a crowed, and with this small amount of people you could actually have the chance to clear your mind with being bothered with other people chatting.</p>
<p>My Thursday is completed by going back to home and having a good nap ðŸ˜‰</p>
