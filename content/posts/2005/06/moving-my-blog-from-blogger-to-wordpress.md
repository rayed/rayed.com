<p>I am thinking seriously about moving from <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, Blogger is really great service, I mainly choose it because it doesn&#8217;t need any server side scripting at all, i.e. it will work with <a href="http://www.saudi.net.sa/">SAUDI NET</a> <a href="http://myweb.saudi.net.sa/">myweb</a> service.<br />
But lately I moved some parts of my site to a new server, and I now have a more reliable Apache+PHP+MySQL installation, and start playing with wordpress and it was really cool feature, I even built a plugin ðŸ™‚<br />
any way here is my test wordpress page: (http://rayed.rayed.com/wordpress/)</p>
