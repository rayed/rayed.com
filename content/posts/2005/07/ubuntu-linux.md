<p>Lately I raed (and heared) a lot of good things about <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu Linux</a>, my understanding is that Ubuntu is a user friendly <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> (I am sure it is more than that).</p>
<p>My friend Osama Aldosari gave me a copy of Ubuntu CD, and made think of installing it on my laptop, more to come one the experince.</p>
