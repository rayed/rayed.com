<p><a href="http://swish-e.org/">Swish-e</a> (Simple Web Indexing System for Humans &#8211; Enhanced) is really nice small program that index almost anything, I am playing with it at the moment and I am thinking of dumping my own search engine and replace it with Swish-e.</p>
<p>Swish has many features but the one feature that stroke me is the speed:<br />
<code>66,548 files indexed.  164,076,410 total bytes.  26,496,024 total words.<br />
Elapsed time: 00:02:44 CPU time: 00:02:31<br />
Indexing done!</code></p>
<p>Yep 66,548 document in less than 3 minutes!!!! Really impressive.</p>
