<p>Last week I rediscovered <a href="http://www.arabeyes.org/">ArabEyes</a> which is a web site dedicated for Arabic UNIX software, they host many Arabic projects.<br />
One of the hosted projects is Quran project, they produced many XML files of Quran text, and they needed help with collecting data, both textual data, and audio data.<br />
So I talked with Abdullah Aldosari about it, and it happened that he have MySQL table with this kind of data, so I processed the table and convert it UTF-8 to be complatible with ArabEyes and UNIX, my plan is to cleanup this data and contibue it back to ArabEyes.<br />
Meanwhile I started playing with this data and created a web based Quran software, please try it out.<br />
<a href="http://dev.rayed.com/islam/quran/">Quran</a><br />
It uses <a href="http://www.ajaxmatters.com/">AJAX</a> to make fast and user friendly interface.<br />
