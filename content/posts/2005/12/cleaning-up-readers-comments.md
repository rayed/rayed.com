<p>When reading <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/">alriyadh.com</a> readers comments, I found many readers using bad practices when posting comments for example:</p>

- Repeating one character many times, e.g. &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;, &#8220;!!!!!&#8221;, &#8220;?????&#8221;, etc..
- Using empty lines
- Using Kasheda to format Arabic strings.
- Using more than one space between words.
- [Misspelling &#8220;لكن&#8221;](/posts/2005/11/spelling-mistakes-drive-me-crazy/)


<p>So I wrote a filter to remove all these practices.</p>
<p>What do you think? good or bad idea, please tell me what do you think.</p>
