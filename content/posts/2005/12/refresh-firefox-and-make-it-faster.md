<p>Today I tried to install <a href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/">LiveHTTPHeaders</a> extension and I had to kill FireFox in the middle of installation process, so I ended up with half installed extension,  I tried to install it again to find out two copies of the same extension one working the other just showing in the list without being able to do anything with it.</p>
<p>Then I decided to remove manually, to find out 340M temporary files in the profile directory, so I decided to replace the complete profile, and create new one again.</p>
<p>So I renamed the directory:<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\rayed\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox<br />
to:<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\rayed\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox.old<br />
and started Firefox again.</p>
<p>Of course you will lose all password, bookmark, history, cookie, extensions, but believe me it is worth it, firefox became super fast, and pop ups are appearing very quickly.</p>
