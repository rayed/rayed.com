<p>but after two months üôÅ<br />
STC is under going a massive deployment in DSL lines in 2006, they announced that they will increase the number of DSL lines kingdom wide from 50,000 line to 500,000 line by the end of 2006!<br />
So I decided to call the STC service number 907, and order DSL, they gave me an appointment today to tell me if the line is ready or not, no called me, so I called and they told the &#8220;Moather&#8221; exchange -which my area belongs to- will get DSL access in 26/1/1427 Hejjri which corresponds to 25/2/2006 according to <a href="http://www.islamicfinder.org/Hcal/hdate_hj.php?month=1&#038;year=1427">IslamicFinder</a><br />
I&#8217;ll be waiting.</p>
