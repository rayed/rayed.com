<p><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> is my favourite email client, I really love it.<br />
The only problem I face is when writing an Arabic email, the problem is with changed the direction of text from &#8220;Left to Right&#8221; (ltr) to &#8220;Right to Left&#8221; (rtl).</p>
<p><a href="/static/uploads/old/2005-12-04/thunderbird.png"><img src='/static/uploads/old/2005-12-04/thunderbird-small.png' align="right" alt='' /></a><br />
The trick works like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the toolbar change the text alignment to the right.</li>
<li>Double click on the line.</li>
<li>The &#8220;Advanced Property Editor&#8221; will popup, it will allow you to add any custom attribute to the current section.</li>
<li>In &#8220;Attribute&#8221; add &#8220;dir&#8221;, and in the &#8220;Value&#8221; add &#8220;rtl&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure we will have some short cut in the future, I know there is an extension for supporting &#8220;Right to Left&#8221; but I guess it is old, and I personally prefer built in support.</p>
<p>In Firefox you can use the short cut &#8220;CTRL+SHIFT+X&#8221; to change the direction.</p>
