<p>Whenever I install new machine or a new browser I download one HTML file and make it my home page.</p>
<p>This start page contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search form for many of my favourite search engines.</li>
<li>Links to my favourite links.</li>
</ul>
<p>The start page save me a lot of time typing, since it have links of frequently used websites.</p>
<p>Give it a try, <a href="/start/">My Start Page</a>.</p>
