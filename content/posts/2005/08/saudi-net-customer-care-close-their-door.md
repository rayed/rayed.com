<p>This week SAUDI NET customer care team left NCCI building and moved to one of the STC (out parent company) headquarter buildings.</p>
<p>The customer care works in shifts 24 hours a day, and today it is the first time since I came to SAUDI NET 5 years ago I come to my office and no one else in our floor except me.</p>
<p>I rarely chat with the guys in customer care, I am not very social person after all, but today I really missed them a lot, I really feel a huge void in my life, very sad moment indeed.</p>
