<p><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> is a web development framework written in Ruby computer language.<br />
It is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.<br />
Smarty does a good job in the areas of View-Controller in PHP language, but I always had a feeling that the model part can be improved, but no idea how. I raed a little about Object-Relational mapping but it seems very complicated and very restircting.<br />
Ruby on Rails on the other hand does a good job in the these 3 areas, specially the Model part, they have something called ActiveRecord which maps database tables.<br />
There are also PHP clone for Ruby on Rails, <a href="http://cakephp.org/">Cake PHP</a>, it is still in its early phases, but could give a feeling of what Ruby on Rails can offer.</p>
