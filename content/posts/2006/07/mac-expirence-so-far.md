<h2>The Bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mouse movement: Mac OS has very strange mouse movement, if you move the mouse slowly it moves &#8220;very&#8221; slow, and if you move it faster it move &#8220;very&#8221; fast. I couldn&#8217;t get used to it until now and it drives me crazy.<br />
I tried different software to fix this weired behavior, but it is still awkward.</li>
<li>Arabic support is really bad:
<ul>
<li>Keyboard layout is different than PC layout, which is frustrating for PC converts.</li>
<li>Most soft wares don&#8217;t provide good support for Arabic, Front page doesn&#8217;t connect Arabic characters. Apple iWork Pages doesn&#8217;t even support right to left writing.</li>
<li>Writing in &#8220;bold&#8221; in Arabic font is the same as non bold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software updates are huge, I guess they don&#8217;t have incremental update, you need to download the complete software whenever a new version exists. e.g. I am downloading 51M update for QuickTime, and you have to restart the machines afterward!! So far I downloaded more than 1 GB for software update!!</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is UNIX ðŸ™‚</li>
<li>In Mac OS an application is a complete folder when you click the folder the application runs. So software installation is very easy, you just move the folder to where you want to your application folder. To uninstall move the folder to the trash.</li>
<li>The graphics are awesome, wallpapers, screen savers, application everything is cool!</li>
<li>The machines is really great looking, and the 20&#8243; monitor is really amazing and bright.</li>
<li>Super quite you don&#8217;t hear any noise.</li>
<li>Mac OS sleep feature is really fast, one click and the machine is running in less than a second!!</li>
</ul>
