<p>Today a friend of mine opened my old web site <a href="http://myweb.saudi.net.sa/rayed/">http://myweb.saudi.net.sa/rayed/</a> and I noticed that my flickr badge is working again! I thought he used an external proxy, but he wasn&#8217;t 🙂<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> is open again but is it for good or it is just a mistake from ISU.<br />
I enabled my Flickr badge again, I miss Flickr!<br />
<b>UPDATE:</b> ISU blocked flickr again 🙁<br />
<b>UPDATE:</b> It is open now, I am confused!<br />
<b>UPDATE:</b> It seems that Flickr is open in Riyadh proxies, and not on Jeddah proxies, I hope it is closed by mistake.</p>
