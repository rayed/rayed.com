<p>I developed a new Javascript based feed for <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com">alriyadh.com</a> that can be included easily in any website, all you need is cut-n-paste some HTML code (mostly Javascript) into your web page and you will get all the news you need.<br />
The script is customizable you can select the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What section you want to view.</li>
<li>How many links in each section.</li>
<li>How do you want to view the links.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give it a try and tell me what do you think, remember it is still under development, so please don&#8217;t complain about the design ðŸ™‚<br />
