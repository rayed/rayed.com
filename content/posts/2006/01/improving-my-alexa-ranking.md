<p>I really hate <a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a>, and I never trust their ranking method, you must install their toolbar to get counted but I never saw any one using their toolbar, but unfortunately it is the only was to measure website popularity.</p>
<p>Any way I am going to use <a href="http://www.a9.com/">A9</a> toolbar (which is part of Amazon, who in turn own Alexa), and I added Alexa Badge in the bottom of my page to see how this will affect my website ranking.</p>
<p>As of today my ranking is: 1,603,040. We will see how it goes ðŸ™‚</p>
