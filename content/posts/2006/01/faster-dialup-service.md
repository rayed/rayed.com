<p>SAUDI NET is testing new dialup service, the new service uses PPP compression to give faster links, the difference is noticeable espically with HTML pages. Of course images and binary files get less compression which mean you won&#8217;t notice a big difference with them.</p>
<p>The service is tested with SAUDI NET prepaid service only (Phone: 3604567), if tests went ok we deploy it on SAUDI NET EasyNet (Phone: 3660077).</p>
<p>Improvemnt of performance depeneds on your browsing behaviour, but 25% is the average increase. So if you connect using 45K you will really get 56K, and if you connect with 52K speed you will get 65K.</p>
