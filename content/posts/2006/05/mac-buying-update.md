<p><img src="/static/uploads/old/2006-05-16/adam.png" align="right"/>Today I contacted <a href="http://www.adamsa.com/">ADAM</a> -the Apple distributer in Jeddah- by email and they replied after 20 minutes, which is a good thing, here is the reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Our branch in Riyadh is for whole sale only, but we can send you what ever you need from Jeddah.<br />
The intel iMac 20&#8243; is for 7500SR not including shipping.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In another front Apple announced the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html">MacBook</a> which replaced the iBook, it cost $1099 which is really attractive, but with only 13&#8243; screen, it can be a good gift though.</p>
