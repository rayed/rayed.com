<p>I noticed that <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> takes more than 100MB from my memory, I thought it would cache something and I didn&#8217;t get that much thought, specially when it very clever to adjust the cache based on my memory. But yesterday it took 170MB from my notebook 256MB, this huge!!</p>
<p>Today I chatted with <a href="http://blog.ibraq.com/">Abdullah</a> about Firefox memory consumption, and he said it is normal on his machine, Strange! I restarted Firefox on Safemode to see if anything in my settings or extension are wrong. Yeppy! Firefox back to normal in 20MB range.</p>
<p>I deleted my extension one after another until I found out that the problem was with Google toolbar extension, as soon as I disabled it Firefox is using regualr amount of memory, what are they doing with the extra 100MB!!! any how I decided to remove it, the only feature I needed is the spell checker and no spell checker worth 100MB.</p>
<p>Note to self: remove google toolbar from all machines.</p>
