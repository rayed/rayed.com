<p><a href="http://www.cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> version 1.0 is released, CakePHP in thier word is:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cake is a rapid development framework for PHP which uses commonly known design patterns like ActiveRecord, Association Data Mapping, Front Controller and MVC. Our primary goal is to provide a structured framework that enables PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web applications, without any loss to flexibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have tried it few times and it is really intersting peace of software, many say CakePHP is <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> clone.</p>
