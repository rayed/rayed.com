<p>Today I went to Apple Store in Riyadh looking for a Mac, I was interested in the 17&#8243; iMac, but after seeing the 20&#8243; iMac the 17&#8243; won&#8217;t satisfy me, it was really amazing and looks much prettier in real life.</p>
<p>The bad side is the price, the 17&#8243; cost 6500SR ($1730), and the 20&#8243; cost 8400SR ($2240), keep in mind that in the US the 17&#8243; cost $1299 ($430 difference), and the 20&#8243; cost $1699 ($541 difference).</p>
<p>Does any one know any other place in Riyadh you can get a cheaper Macs?</p>
