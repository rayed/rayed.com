<p><a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/">Alriyadh.com</a> launched a new website for covering the FIFA world cup 2006, the website can be found here <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/worldcup/">http://www.alriyadh.com/worldcup</a>.</p>
<p>The new site isn&#8217;t a regular news website, it is a new web application specifically designed for the world cup, it would be also updated in real time, i.e. you can follow any match events while it is still in play, of course you will still find regular coverage like news, and photos.</p>
<p>You will also find plenty of information about the current cup including information about teams, players, coaches, cities and stadiums.</p>
<p>Special section on the world cup history is also added with plenty of information about great players, old champions, and very interesting statistics from older world cup.</p>
<p>Give it a visit and tell me what you think.</p>
