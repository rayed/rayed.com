<p>Every few years I think of buying a Mac machine, usually it happens after Apple annonce new cool thing, first the PowerPC CPU which was really amazing back in the 90s, then with Mac OS X being built on top of UNIX, then lately with the introduction of Intel based Macs.</p>
<p>Also 6 months ago my friend <a href="http://fqaqee3.net/">Misfer</a> bough a PowerBook, and he loves s much.</p>
<p>So is it time to convert to Mac, Mac machines are generally more expensive than Windows machines, especially here in Saudi Arabia, and I only know one store that sells Macs.</p>
<p>Currenlty I am thinking of buying Mac with Intel processor, and they offer the following machines:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">iMac</a> desktop machine.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a> just a machine with no screen, keyboard, or mouse.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> laptop.</li>
</ul>
<p>any suggestion regarding converting to Mac, is it worth it or not, any comments are appreicated.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Apple will introduce a new Intel based laptop that will replace iBook, it will be called MacBook.</p>
