Today I'll end my [Alexa experiment](/posts/2006/01/improving-my-alexa-ranking/). During the last 60 days I tried to improve my Alexa ranking, my ranking jumped from 1,603,040 to 133,430.

Today I removed Alexa ranking banner in my website footer, and I'll remove all A9 toolbar extension from Firefox, it is occupying 20,000 pixels from my screen and I rarely use it.
