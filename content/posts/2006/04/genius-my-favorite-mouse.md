<p>A while ago I bought an &#8220;Orange&#8221; mouse for my parents home, I bought it based on a recommendation from a sales man at &#8220;echo&#8221; electronic store. I thought optical mouses reached apoint where all mouses are the same, I was wrong. &#8220;orange&#8221; mouse was very stupid, jumping all the time and it drove my crazy.</p>
<p>So when I went to computer complex at Olaya to buy my DSL modem, I decided to buy a mouse for my parents computer, and since I have a good <a href="http://www.geniusnet.com.tw/">Genius</a> mouse I bought another Genuis mouse for 20SR (Ibought mine for 30SR 3 years ago), and what a difference between the two. Genuis mouse was very wasy moving and no jumping all over the screen, I loved it.</p>
<p>What is you favorite mouse, I know many people like the wireless models, but I never liked them my self, specially when you have to change the batteries every few days.</p>
