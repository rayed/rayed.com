<p>After three months delay from the <a href="http://rayed.com/wordpress/?p=188">inital plan</a> I finally got DSL access.</p>
<p>My friend Abdulaziz Alqudhibi offered me NetGear DSL Modem/Router/Access point for really great price but it will take two days to install, but I couldn&#8217;t wait so I went to the market and bought a SpeedTouch 585, I hope I won&#8217;t regret it.</p>
