After three months delay from the [inital plan](/posts/2005/12/finally-dsl-access/) I finally got DSL access.

My friend Abdulaziz Alqudhibi offered me NetGear DSL Modem/Router/Access point for really great price but it will take two days to install, but I couldn't wait so I went to the market and bought a SpeedTouch 585, I hope I won't regret it
