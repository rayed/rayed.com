<p>Today my friend <a href="http://www.tivity.info/wordpress/">Feras Al-Jumah</a> sent me a link to a WordPress theme called <a href="http://jtkconsulting.com/PaintedDesert/?p=6">PaintedDesert</a>. I liked it so much that I installed it on my blog, hope everybody like it.<br />
Thanks Feras for the link.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of my old theme:<br />
