<p>Extremely slow but still DSL. My phone line got off line for more than a month, after that phone worked but with out DSL for another 2 weeks, during this time I only connect using 28K dial up connection, which is really really slow. </p>
<p><b>Update:</b> I upgraded to 512K and it is awesome, it wasn&#8217;t slow Windows was downloading tons of updates ðŸ™‚</p>
