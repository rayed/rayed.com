<p>I love it, I backed up everything Pictures, Movies, PDF books, ISO images, everything you can image, I wounder why I didn&#8217;t buy one earlier.</p>
<p>My brother in law Turki Almuamer suggests that I should buy one, after his laptop go stolen from Dubai airport with all of his data :(, sorry for your loss Turki, and thank you for the suggestion, and another thanks to <a href="http://blog.ibraq.com/">Abdullah Aldosari</a> for suggestion on where to buy it.</p>
<p>I bough my 80GB Toshiba hard disk for 450SR, I asked around and the price seems reasonable.</p>
