<p>Few days ago while browsing my favourite websites, a pop-up showed asking me to install Firefox 1.5.0.1 &#8230; WOW, I didn&#8217;t have to re-download 4.5MB for Firefox again, this really nice feature.</p>
<p>It also appears to me that the new version 1.5.0.1 much better than the old one, at least in memory consumption, I like it.</p>
