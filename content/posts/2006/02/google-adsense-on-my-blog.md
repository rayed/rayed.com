<p>I signed up with Google AdSense, and you can find Google Ads in sidebar, I am still learning about the AdDense program.<br />
But basically it allow content providers (i.e. owner of Internet websites) to earn money by displaying google ads, and each time a person click on an add it add more credit to him.<br />
To learn more here are some links from Wikipedia links:<br />
