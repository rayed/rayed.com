<p><a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/">alriyadh.com</a> new servers arrived, we are upgrading from 4 Sun Solaris machines to 3 HP machines with <a href="http://www.freebsd.com/">FreeBSD</a>, the machines specification as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dual Xeon 3.40GHz</li>
<li>1GB RAM</li>
<li>4 x 36GB Hard disk</li>
</ul>
<p>The servers should be in production next week, you should notice significant performance improvements Insha Allah.<br />
Other website enhancements will follow that wasn&#8217;t possible with the old hardware.</p>
