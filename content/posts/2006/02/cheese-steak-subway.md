<p>Everyone who know me knows that I love <a href="http://www.subway.com/">Subway</a> subs, but recently I switched to <a href="http://www.quiznos.com/">Quiznos</a> mainly because they toast the sandwiches, yummy my mouth start watering ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>But two days ago I got tired from Quiznos so I went back to Subway and I tried the &#8220;Cheese Steak&#8221;, oh my god, it is really delicious!</p>
<p>The worst thing about Subway that you need to know which topping and sauce is good with what, and of course if you get something wrong it could ruin your sandwich.</p>
<p>So to help you with your &#8220;Cheese Steak&#8221; experience here is my toppings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steak &#038; Cheese (Duh!)</li>
<li>Steak Sauce</li>
<li>Toast the above (yep they have a toaster now!)</li>
<li>Lettuce</li>
<li>Tomato</li>
<li>Onion</li>
<li>Cucumber</li>
</ul>
