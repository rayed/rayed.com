<p>Finally my website <a href="http://rayed.com/">http://rayed.com/</a> became the first result in <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> when searching for &#8220;Rayed&#8221;:<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=rayed">http://www.google.com/search?q=rayed</a></p>
<p>For years and years when you search for my name you will get X-Ray related sites, because the past of the verb &#8220;ray&#8221; is &#8220;rayed&#8221;.</p>
