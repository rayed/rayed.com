<p>Long time ago I built a PHP script that fetch and parse Arabic BBC news and format them in Javscript format, this can be used by adding few HTML code in your website.</p>
<p>The script located at: <a href="http://rayed.com/bbcjs.php3">http://rayed.com/bbcjs.php3</a></p>
<p>I stopped the script more than 5 years ago, but until now I found many entries in my log asking for that file, so I decide to take an action, I put the file back but I put a warning message to notify the user that the script is no longer working.</p>
<p>To see it in action visit: <a href="http://www.alzubair.net/">http://www.alzubair.net/</a></p>
<p>In fact I thought of redirecting the client to an error page like this one:<br />
<a href="http://rayed.com/bbcjs.html">http://rayed.com/bbcjs.html</a><br />
But it might be very drastic measure ðŸ™‚</p>
