<p>Since I upgraded my WordPress to version 2 I used <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> to protect my from comment spam, it did a great job for a while but lately it passes a lot of spam, I am not sure what is the problem but I am suspecting some network problems.</p>
<p>So until I resolve this problem I&#8217;ll try using <a href="http://www.boriel.com/?page_id=17">CaptCha!</a> plug-in, it uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">captcha</a> method to prevent spamming.</p>
<p><img src="/upload/2006-10-31/captcha.jpg" alt="Captcha Image" align="right" /></p>
<p>Captcha works as follow, when you want to submit a comment, the website displays an image with few characters shown in wave shapes, and you requested to type the character you see to accept your comment, the idea is to prevent automatic script from submitting comment because they can not read the character in the screen, even if they used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition">OCR</a> it would be very hard to recognize it.</p>
<p>To give it a try leave a comment and you will understand it ðŸ™‚ If you think it is annoying I&#8217;ll reconsider removing it.</p>
