<p>These days I really don&#8217;t have time on the Internet, but I really want to talk about some of these issue in more depth later.</p>
<ul>
<li>My phone line (including DSL service) is out of service for more than month, and until now no hope üôÅ</li>
<li>IGW the new ISU: STC is now handling Internet gateway operation, the service is still has some issues, and we are still understaffed.</li>
<li>Dev4Islam: Project to devlope open source Islamic and Arabic software and services. We aim to collect data and make it available for other so they can build better software.</li>
<li>Java + Delphi = C# <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg">Anders Hejlsber</a> the creator of Delphi, create a great language for Microsoft.</li>
<li><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/">Lucene</a> is a full text search library, exteremly fast, and the API is awsome. I tested it Lucene .Net port it is really super fast.</li>
<li><a href="http://swish-e.org/">Swish-e</a> same as lucene, this what I use for Alriadh.com, still very good.
</li>
<li>Alriyadh.com new feature: user login for better experince, no need to rewrite your name and email when you want to submit a comment or send article to a friend, and you can bookmark your favourite articles, any thing else we should add.</li>
</ul>
