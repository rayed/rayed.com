<p>Every year or so I have a project in Java I learn enough thing to finish the project then I forget it by getting busy in other proejcts.<br />
Over the years I really loved and hated Java, </p>
<p>Java what to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>: is a Java-based build tool. In theory, it is kind of like Make, without Make&#8217;s wrinkles and with the full portability of pure Java code.</li>
<li><a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat:</a> servlet and JSP server, can work as standalone, with Apache HTTPd, or IIS.</li>
<li><a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/">log4j</a>: log4j is a Java-based logging utility. It is used primarily as a debugging tool.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit:</a> JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language.</li>
</ul>
