<p>Yesterday I went to <a href="http://www.jarirbookstore.com/">Jarir Bookstore</a> between exist 5 and 6, and when I came back to my car I found the passenger glass smashed and all my stuff scattered on the car. Fortunately, I never leave anything in my car, so nothing got stolen, but fixing the damage would cost around 1000 SR.</p>
<p>My brother car got stolen 500m from my Jarir Bookstore near Saco, both accidents happened in less than 6 months period!!</p>
<p>Amazing how Riyadh city became!! Thank you for everyone participated in making Riyadh a safer city.</p>
<p>P.S. During Ramadan I saw a suspicious car driving in my neighborhood so I called 999 (equivalent of 911 in the US), and it rang and rang and no body answers!!!</p>
