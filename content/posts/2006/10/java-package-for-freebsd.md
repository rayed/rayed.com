Fortunately FreeBSD Foundation has binary package for Java, all you need is to <a href="http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/downloads/java.shtml">Download</a> and install using:

    # pkg_add diablo-jdk-freebsd5.i386.1.5.0.07.01.tbz

and you are done.

With Java on FreeBSD may be I will start playing with <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/java/">Lucene</a> instead of <a href="http://swish-e.org/">Swish-e</a> as <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/">Alriyadh</a> search engine.
