<p>Recently the 2 most popular browsers IE and Firefox released a new version.</p>
<p>Firefox is already a very good product so improving it is very hard ðŸ™‚ The most important new feature is the online spell checker which is really lovely. It also has a new theme, I didn&#8217;t like that much but it might take some time to get used to.</p>
<p>IE 7 in the other hand is really impressive (compared to IE 6 of course), it has tab browsing at last, the theme is really really good, the new font rendering engine is really smooth and clear it feels like a Mac.</p>
<p>Of course IE 7 has tons of bug fixes in many areas including security (we will see about that) and CSS rendering.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> Font rendering in IE7 is the normal ClearType you can enable to all application from:<br />
Display Properties->Appearance->Effects<br />
But notice it will look good if you have LCD display.</p>
