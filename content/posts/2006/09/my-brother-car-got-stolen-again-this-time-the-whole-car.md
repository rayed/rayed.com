<p>Few months ago my brother Fouad went to <a href="http://saco-ksa.com/">SACO</a> hardware store, unfortunately he forgot his wallet in the car, as soon as he remembered it he went back to the car to find the window broken and all his belongings stolen, including his wallet and his work briefcase, he reported the accident to his bank within few minutes to deactivate his VISA card, but it was too late they thief already purchased 17,000 SR worth of good including laptops and mobile phones, all this happened in less than an hour!!!! Until he is still talking to the bank to return it back.</p>
<p>Yesterday another incident happened, my brother just entered his home after spending one day in the hospital for a minor operation, he sent his driver to get something from Bal Sharaf department store, the driver called shortly telling him that some guys hit the car from the back and when he left the car to check it out, 5 guys got off their car hit him and took the car keys from the diver and escaped.</p>
<p>The same incident happens over and over before, the same scenario; hit the car when the driver leave his vehicle to check the accident they hit him and escape with both cars. Those thieves have been captured many times before the problem that they always get short sentence and they leave the jail shortly.<br />
In fact we were talking about them few days ago, and who they were 3 members and after spending few months in the jail they became 5 members.</p>
<p>All I can say is god help you Fouad, and In Shal Allah you will be rewarded in heaven for these unfortunate events that happening to you.</p>
<p>Of course a special thank to our legal system represented by our beloved judges, if you have a &#8220;chance&#8221; to be present in front of a judge in Saudi Arabia you know how stupid our legal system is, if you are willing to lie you can&#8217;t get convicted on anything, and guess what, all criminal are liars!!</p>
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> 5 days later the police found the car, without the wheels of course, the condition is unknown since we couldn&#8217;t move it yet. Alahamdu Lelah ðŸ™‚</p>
