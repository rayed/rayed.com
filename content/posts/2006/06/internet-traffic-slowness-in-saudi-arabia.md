<p>These days Internet backbone in Saudi Arabia is having many problems affecting mainly DSL customers in some areas. I guess it must be related to the boom in new DSL connections.</p>
<p>To make things worst the school vacation just started and the Internet browsing became very very slow.</p>
<p>Thank god that I host my website at <a xhref="http://www.saudi.net.sa/">SAUDI NET</a> so no speed prolem with it.</p>
