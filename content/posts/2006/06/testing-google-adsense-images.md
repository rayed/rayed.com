<p>It has been 4 months since I put Google ads on my site, and so far the result are rediclousy funny, I only earned $4 ðŸ™‚ , I didn&#8217;t expect to get anything at all, and even if I did I doubt that they will send to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Today, I noticed an ad that I didn&#8217;t like and it appeared very frequently, so I decided to block it, fortunately Google have a mechanisim for that but it will take some time, so I decided to switch from text ads to image ads, and change the location of the banner to better place, and I will wait to see how it will affect my earnings.</p>
<p>I hope someone come up with an Arabic version of GoogleAds.</p>
<p>P.S. support my site and visit our sponsers ðŸ™‚</p>
