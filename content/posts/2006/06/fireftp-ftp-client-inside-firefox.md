<p>I always have trouble finding and recommending FTP clients to friends, I used to use WS_FTP but it isn&#8217;t free, same thing for Cute FTP.</p>
<p>Lately I didn&#8217;t use FTP client any more, because I start using <a href="http://htmlkit.com/">HTMLKit</a> it isn&#8217;t an FTP client per se, it is an editor with the ability to open remote files using FTP, so I do most of my file editing using it.</p>
<p>HTMLKit is great but it doesn&#8217;t support moving files or directories, or transfaering a complete directory. In these cases I usually log to the machine using SSH and do the need operations using the command line, but this not an option for most people.</p>
<p>Today I raed about FireFTP extension for Firefox in an article at <a href="http://www.download.com/Best-Firefox-extensions-Volume-III/1200-11745_4-5162308.html">Download.com</a>  I knew that there is an FTP Client extension but I never tried it before, fortunately I did and is AWESOME!! and the best part it is only 100KB, so if you need an FTP client give a try.</p>
