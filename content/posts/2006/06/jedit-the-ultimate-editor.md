<a href="http://rayed.com/wordpress/?p=136">A year ago</a> <a href="http://www.waleedsgallery.biz/">Waleed Alzuhair</a> asked me about the reason I am still using Windows-1256 Arabic character set, intead of the new standard Unicode. My reason was the lack of good editor that support Arabic and Unicode, my favourite eidtor HTML-Kit doesn&#8217;t have any support for Unicode.<br />
But lately while looking for an editor for Mac OS I found <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">JEdit</a>, it is a Java based editor which means it will work with any OS, it supports many charachter sets including Unicode UTF-8, another intersting feature is its support (through a plugin) of remote editing using both FTP, and SFTP  (HTML-Kit doesn&#8217;t support SFTP).</p>
