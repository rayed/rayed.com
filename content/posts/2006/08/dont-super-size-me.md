<p>Yesterday I visited one of my favourite fast food resturants, <a href="http://herfy.com/">Herfy</a>, and I order my usual meal &#8220;Super Herfy&#8221;. It usually cost 15 SR, but when I ordered it he asked me for 17 SR!! then I remembered that some resturants super size your meal without asking, I usually expect this kind of practice from &#8220;Hardee&#8217;s&#8221; and &#8220;KFC&#8221; not from Herfy.</p>
<p>I hate super sizing in general, because they super size the french fries and the drink, and I am not a big fan of both, and the medium serving is more than enough for me. But if you are offering super sizing my burgers this is a different story ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Super sizing is one thing, super sizing without asking is another thing, I hope someone sue all the resturants super sizing without asking.</p>
<p>I know many people consider french fries the best food on the planet!! But not me and for this reason I think that all resturants should offer a salad as replacement for french fries without any extra cost.</p>
<p><b>Food facts</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The normal adult should consume 2000 calories a day.</li>
<li>McDonald&#8217;s BigMac = 560 calories. <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/app_controller.nutrition.index1.html">ref</a></li>
<li>McDonald&#8217;s Large French Fries = 570. (medium=380)</li>
<li>Coca Cola medium = 210. (diet=0)</li>
<li><b>Super sizied BigMac meal = 1340, i.e 67% of your daily calories needs.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Herfy Doesn&#8217;t have similar nutrition fact sheet, because Saudi Laws don&#8217;t mandiate it yet.</p>
