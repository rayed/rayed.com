<p>Recently I was developing a Chat system software that can be used from regular browser window, the requirement for the client can be found on almost all browsers, it needs to run JavaScript1 .5+, Java1 .0+, as far I know there are some versions of WindowsXP that don&#8217;t have Java at all, of course you can download WindowsXP Java plugin from http://www.sun.com/.<br />Give a test drive Chat!</p>
