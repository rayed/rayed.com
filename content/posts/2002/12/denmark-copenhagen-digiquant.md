<p>I spent a week in Copenhagen, Denemark.<br />I went for training on , it was very good.<br />The weather was very cold in the first day, but I think I got used to it. Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t have time for sight seeing.<br /><a href="http://www.rayed.com/img/digiquant.jpg">Picture of me and some colleges</a></p>
