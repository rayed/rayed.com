<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/17/business/worldbusiness/17engineers.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">High-Tech Japanese, Running Out of Engineers</a></p>
<blockquote><p>After years of fretting over coming shortages, the country is actually facing a dwindling number of young people entering engineering and technology-related fields.</p>
<p>Universities call it “rikei banare,” or “flight from science.” The decline is growing so drastic that industry has begun advertising campaigns intended to make engineering look sexy and cool, and companies are slowly starting to import foreign workers, or sending jobs to where the engineers are, in Vietnam and India.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t in Japan only, US, Europe, even countries with low numbers of engineers like Saudi Arabia are seeing a decline in the number of Engineer students. Are we going to face an engineering dark age, or is it normal phase after the engineering golden age!</p>
