<p>Very good read about cloud computing, trust me it worth it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I strongly believe that cloud computing (or computing as a utility) is the way computing is going to evolve over the next few years/decades.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>[t]he two biggest computing-providers of today, Amazon as well as Google, are building their concurrent offerings on top of really concurrent programming languages and systems. Not only because they want to, but because they need to. If you want to build computing into a utility, you need large real-time systems running as efficiently as possible. You need your technology to be able to scale in a similar way as other, comparable utilities or large real-time systems are scaling â€” utilities like telephony and electricity.
