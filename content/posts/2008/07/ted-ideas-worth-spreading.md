<blockquote><p>TED (Technology Entertainment Design) is an annual conference [&#8230;] It defines its mission as &#8220;ideas worth spreading&#8221;, and selected talks given at TED are available free on its website. Its lectures cover a broad set of topics: science, arts, design, politics, culture, business, global issues, technology, and entertainment.</p></blockquote>

<p>So many inspiring talks (in Video and Audio format), you will find it really hard to keep listening because the inspiration effect is almost instant.</p>
<p>I have mixed feeling now, inspired to do something worthy, and shame for wasting my life so far.</p>
