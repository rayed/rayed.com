<p>I&#8217;ve just upgraded my Blogging software to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> latest version 2.5</p>
<p>Since I skipped a version I noticed huge improvements, tags, widgets, new dashboard, new interfaces, more info in this post <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-brecker/">WordPress 2.5</a></p>
