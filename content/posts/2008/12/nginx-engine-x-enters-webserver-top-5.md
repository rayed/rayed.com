<a href="http://nginx.net/">nginx</a> [Engine X] became the world 4th most popular web server, according to the latest <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2008/12/24/december_2008_web_server_survey.html">Netcraft survey</a>.<br />
It is an event based web server, which makes really scalable especially for static files, so if you are serving many images, audio files, video, you might consider it.<br />
It can also configured to work as HTTP and mail proxy.<br />
Of course you should look also at <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">Lighttpd [Lighty]</a> which work with the same principle, and I have been using it for around 2 years for <a href="http://www.alriyadh.com/">alriyadh.com</a></p>
