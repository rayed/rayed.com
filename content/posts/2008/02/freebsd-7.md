<p>FreeBSD 7 is available, many new improvements performance and feature wise, check the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/7.0R/announce.html">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>One of the most impressive improvements is SMP (Symmetric multiprocessing):</p>
<blockquote><p>Dramatic improvements in performance and SMP scalability shown by various database and other benchmarks, in some cases showing peak performance improvements as high as 350% over FreeBSD 6.X under normal loads and 1500% at high loads. When compared with the best performing Linux kernel (2.6.22 or 2.6.24) performance is 15% better</p></blockquote>
