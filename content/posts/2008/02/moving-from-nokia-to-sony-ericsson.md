<p>After spending couple of years with Siemens, and 6 years with Nokia, I decided to convert my mobile to SonyEricsson, I switched to <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/t650i?cc=ae&#038;lc=en">SonyEricsson T650i</a>.</p>
<p>So far I like it, the OS is fast and so far reliable, the screen is very colorful and smooth, the camera is descent with auto focus feature which I love, and I really loved the design. Need sometime to get used to the back button.</p>
