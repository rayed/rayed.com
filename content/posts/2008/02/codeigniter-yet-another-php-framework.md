<p>For the last year I spent a lot of my PHP time playing with <a href="http://www.cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> I like it at first, but when I tried to build large applications with it I noticed it have major issues with performance, plus I really had difficult time dealing with it is strict naming convention and it object-relational-mapping (ORM).</p>
<p>Few days ago I read about <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a> framework and its similarities to CakePHP and its amazing performance, so I went and visited their website again, I heard about CodeIgniter before from Abdullah Aldosari (I miss our technical discussions) but when I visited the website I wasn&#8217;t really impressed, but the new website looks much better, so judging by the look improvement alone I decided to give it a try ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>My first impressions are good, things I liked about CodeIgniter so far: </p>
<ul>
<li>There is no magic, what you write is what you get, you need to explicitly define what you need.</li>
<li>Very fast.</li>
<li>You can have directories in your controller,model, or view. I really hated CakePHP flat structure</li>
</ul>
<p>It is still very early for me to discover its shortcoming, but so far I like.</p>
