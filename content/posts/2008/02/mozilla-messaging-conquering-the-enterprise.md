<p>Mozilla Foundation the people behind Firefox are launching a new Foundation <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/">Mozilla Messaging</a>, their objective is to improve how people communicate on the Internet. Of course they will start with my favorite email client <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird </a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The initial focus for Mozilla Messaging is the development of Thunderbird 3, which will deliver significant improvements, notably integrated calendaring, better search and enhancements to the overall user experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Thunderbird improve its collaboration features it will be great contender in the Enterprise Collaboration arena, watch out &#8220;Lotus Notes&#8221; and &#8220;Outlook&#8221;.</p>
