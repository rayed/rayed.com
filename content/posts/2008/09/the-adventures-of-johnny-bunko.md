A friend recommended that I read &#8220;The Adventures of Johnny Bunko&#8221;, I read it and I loved it, thought I should share it with others too.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Adventures of Johnny Bunko is America’s first business book in manga and the last career guide you’ll ever need.</p>
<p>The book, which you can read in an hour, tells the story of Johnny Bunko, a beleaguered Everyman toiling away at the Boggs Corp.</p>
<p>One night Johnny meets Diana, a magical and butt-kicking adviser who teaches Johnny &#8212; and you &#8212; the six lessons of satisfying, productive careers:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no plan.</li>
<li>Think strengths, not weaknesses.</li>
<li>It’s not about you.</li>
<li>Persistence trumps talent.</li>
<li>Make excellent mistakes.</li>
<li>Leave an imprint.</li>
</ol>
