<p>Django team released version 1.0 of the their web application framework, Django is written in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>.</p>
<p>I only tried Django for a week more than one year ago, and it was really amazing, and easy to create web application.</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t write in Python I recommend you spend sometime to know it, may be walk through the tutorial. It has many inspiring and brilliant features you definitely need to know before select your next web framework.</p>
