It seems that Saudi Telecom Company (STC) is going to change its logo, the new logo is all over Riyadh, without any reference to STC, with only the slogan "What good is technology if doesn't make your life easier (poorly translated)".

<img src="/static/uploads/2008/09/logo.jpg" alt="" title="STC Logo" width="240" height="80" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-418" />

This time STC is using the logo one of the companies STC bought, STC bought 51% of Indonesian GSM operator Natrindo, and AXIS is the brand name used by Natrindo.

I like the new logo better than the old one, it seems modern and futuristic, not a big fan of the colors.

May be STC isn't going to use this one, and they want to surprise us with a different one, and they want to create a buzz before the actual surprise logo.
