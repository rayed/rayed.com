<p>It seems that Saudi Telecom Company (STC) is going to change its logo, the new logo is all over Riyadh, without any reference to STC, with only the slogan &#8220;What good is technology if doesn&#8217;t make your life easier (poorly translated)&#8221;.</p>
<p><img src="http://rayed.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/logo.jpg" alt="" title="STC Logo" width="240" height="80" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-418" /></p>
<p>This time STC is using the logo one of the companies STC bought, STC bought 51% of Indonesian GSM operator Natrindo, and AXIS is the brand name used by Natrindo.</p>
<p>I like the new logo better than the old one, it seems modern and futuristic, not a big fan of the colors.</p>

<p>May be STC isn&#8217;t going to use this one, and they want to surprise us with a different one, and they want to create a buzz before the actual surprise logo.</p>
