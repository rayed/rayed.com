<p>I am moving all my emails (except work email) to one single email using my own domain (myname at mydomain), and I am going to use Google Apps service, basically I am getting GMail for my own domain, I even have my own start page and tons of applications.</p>
<p>The provided storage is unbeatable, and after Google provided IMAP service, it is really tempting.</p>
<p>So guys if you want to contact me please do at myname at mydomain.</p>
