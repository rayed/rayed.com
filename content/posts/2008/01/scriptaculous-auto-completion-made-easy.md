<p>I was not a big fan of JavaScript, until new cool technologies emerged that utilize JavaScript in really useful ways, the most impressive of course would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a> related functionality.</p>
<p>AJAX is really easy to use, put some features are hard to implement which lead to JavaScript libraries emerging every where, the most popular are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">Yahoo! UI</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> and <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">script.aculo.us</a></li>
<li><a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve played with Yahoo! UI it was really powerful and have many features, but it was getting complicated by time, the last time I tried to implement auto complete feature it took me a whole day üôÅ</p>
<p>So I decided to give script.aculo.us a try, and it was 10 times easier to implement, and the distrbution size is also much smaller 148K, Yahoo! UI reached 7MB.</p>
<p>script.aculo.us include libraries for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animation</li>
<li>AJAX</li>
<li>Drag and Drop</li>
<li>Slider control</li>
</ul>
