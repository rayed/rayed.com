Two separate friends are visiting Hong Kong soon, they asked for tips about Hong Kong this it what I remembered, hope others find it useful.

Overall Hong Kong is very beautiful and modern city, hotel prices are bit high (with the weak dollar everything is), transportation is very good and efficient, the food is good and you can find Halal food in many places but you have to ask for.


### Stay at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon">Kowloon</a>

The most important regions of Hong Kong are "Hong Kong Island" and "Kowloon" and they are divided by sea, I recommend staying in Kowloon because:

- Hotels are relatively cheaper
- You can get anywhere using the metro, so it won't make any difference.
- You get more chances to see this:

### <a href="http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/aguide/airportex.html">Airport Express</a>

Around 20 min to Hong Kong, with a free shuttle bus to most hotels. They also have special pass for 3 days of unlimited travel.


### <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus_card">Octopus card</a>

Octopus is a very convenient contact less smart card that you can use to buy all transport tickets -metro,bus,airport express-, it can be used in many convenience stores, supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, and vending machines.

Get one from the airport and charge it, and don't forget to get your HK$50 refundable deposit on you leave Hong Kong.


### Hong Kong Walks

A small booklet with many interesting and paths to help you explore Hong Kong, I got my free edition from the airport, but you can download and print it from this link:
