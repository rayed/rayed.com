<blockquote><p>PuTTY Tray is an improved version of PuTTY. It features some cosmetic changes, and a number of addons to make it more useful and much more fun to use.</p></blockquote>
<p>The features that I really like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimizing to the system tray</li>
<li>Portability: optionally stores session configuration in files (for example: on a USB drive) like portaPuTTY</li>
<li>Reconnects when your PC wakes up from stand-by / Attempts to reconnect when the connection fails</li>
</ul>
