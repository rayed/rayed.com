<p>According to this <a href="http://money.cnn.com/pf/features/popups/costofliving/popup.html">link from CNN</a> the cost of living in Riyadh is ranked #77 out of 144 cities.<br />I wonder with the current oil price where are we heading and the worst part that we aren&#8217;t getting a dime from it!</p>
