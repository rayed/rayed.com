<p>I went to the traffic department to follow-up on my car accident report, I was told that the guy who hit me came and gave them his insurance -which won&#8217;t help since he escaped-, and they told me to go Car dealer (Al Hamza, Sheikh Almared) to get an estimate for the car repair.<br />After search for 20 minutes for the car dealer shop -the shop didn&#8217;t have a banner!!- I found it and they ask for 30 Riyals for the car estimate, they send me back to the Traffic department with a sealed envelope with the repair estimate, which was 1700 riyals.<br />The traffic department now will contact the guy to get the money from him, it could take months as they said!<br />Any way I&#8217;ll wait and see how our judicial system work.</p>
<p>These related information needed to follow later, just for my reference ðŸ™‚<br />FILE: 28<br />DATE: Friday 16/4/1425 <br />OFFICE: 8<br />CASE: Escaping (Faisal Alsoaeleh)</p>
