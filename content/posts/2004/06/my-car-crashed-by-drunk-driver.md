<p>On my way to my parents home to help my sister with her math exam a drunk driver (I think) hit my car and escaped! I stopped him, and called the cups, they told me to get his car plate and leave him.<br />My friends told me that I am not going to get any money to repair my car from him, but I&#8217;ll try my best with the traffic department to catch him.</p>
