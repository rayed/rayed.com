<p>If you use MS Internet Explorer and you have one of the following:</p>
<li>Many toolbars that you didn&#8217;t install, and you couldn&#8217;t remove.
<li>Pop-up windows from nowhere, coming from all Internet web sites, even the ones you know they didn&#8217;t have any.
<li>Slow machine.
<li>Slow connection.
<p>Then you diffently need to install Lavasoft <a href="http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/">AD-Aware</a>, and remove all the ad, and spywares.<br />Just try it.</p>
