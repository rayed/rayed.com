<p>I was planning to install spamassassin+amavisd+clamav on our mail server for a long time, but every time I try to do it, I quit after few tries.<br />But finally I got it, and it isn&#8217;t that hard at all, although I don&#8217;t understand everything yet, but it seems easy. Hopefully I&#8217;ll add some configuration hints for <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> of course.</p>
<ul></p>
<li><a href="http://www.spamassassin.org/">Spamassassin</a> is SPAM mail detection software, it became the de facto standard in SPAM fighting.
<li><a href="http://www.clamav.net/">ClamAV</a> is an opensource antivirus program.
<li><a href="http://www.ijs.si/software/amavisd/">amavisd-new</a> is a high-performance interface between mailer (MTA) and content checkers: virus scanners, and/or SpamAssassin.</ul>
