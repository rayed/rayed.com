<p>Yesterday, at 12:00 am while me and my wife watch TV, the  guy living in the apartment above mine start drilling, I start complaining to my wife saying what insensitive neighbor he is. At first I said it won&#8217;t take long, few minutes and he will be over, but the noise didn&#8217;t stop and it became very annoying.<br />At 1:00 am I decided to go to bed and ignore that noise, the strangest thing happened, I didn&#8217;t hear any noise, I went back to the living room to find out that all this noise was coming from an electric tooth brush connected their, which I drop (and apparently broke) few days ago, and it start working and stopping by it self.<br />Sorry neighbor.</p>
