<p>Today EezeeNet phone numbers will be announced for all ISPs, the phone numbers start with 366 instead of 368 announced earlier.<br />EezeeNet is dialup service provided by <a href="http://www.stc.com.sa/">STC</a> to allow customers to connect to the Internet without having ISP account, of course ISP will share the profit with STC for the connection, it costs 3 Riyals per hour, and I guess the ISP share is .65<br />any way I&#8217;ll post the given numbers earlier this day insha Allah.</p>
