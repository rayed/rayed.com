<p>I forwarded request to <a href="http://www.rayed.com/">www.rayed.com</a> to <a href="http://myweb.saudi.net.sa/rayed/">http://myweb.saudi.net.sa/rayed</a>, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To promote using <a href="http://myweb.saudi.net.sa/">myweb</a> service provided by <a href="http://www.saudi.net.sa/">SAUDI NET</a>.</li>
<li>To replace my own blogging software with <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>, I know I can make Blogger publish to rayed.com directly, but I didn&#8217;t want to publish in two locations.<br />
I also migrated all entries from the my own software to Blogger, so nothing lost. (as if there anything worth saving!)</li>
<li>The most important one, is because myweb.saudi.net.sa is much faster than my own server, which is a very old machine, with very limited bandwidth.</li>
</ul>
