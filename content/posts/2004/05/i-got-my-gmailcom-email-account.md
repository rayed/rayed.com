<p>I forgot to mention this earlier, but one week ago when I logged in to <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger.com</a> I got an invetation to try <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">Gmail.com</a> service, if you never heared of Gmail before, it is a webmail service provided by google.com and they give 1GB of space.</p>
