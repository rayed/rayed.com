<p>Today the traffic department called me to telling that they found the car with the description I gave, but the color wasn&#8217;t silver it was gray! So they called me to change the paper I signed earlier. <br /> Silver and gray is there really any difference between the two!?  <br /> The name of the guy who hit me and ran away was Abdullah Mohammed Alsalem. <br /> <!-- Abdullah Mohammed Alsalem 218 xxxx --> </p>
