<p>In the past when you forget to add a PHP extension in FreeBSD you have to recompile the whole thing, but now PHP port support dynamic extensions, in fact PHP port doesn&#8217;t allow you to add any extensions, you have to add these extensions using a separate port.<br />There is one wrapper port called /usr/ports/lang/php4-extensions/ which will allow you to select modules to install.<br />Very nice indeed, even when I spent long time to figure out how to add extensions.</p>
