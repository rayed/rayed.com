<p>I just configured my first MySQL replication, it is very simple to configure, few configuration steps and it is done.<br /> The hardest thing is to figure the location of MySQL configuration file my.cnf under my FreeBSD, it doesn&#8217;t exists by default so you have to create it your self, it can be many place, I choosed /var/db/mysql/my.cnf to make reside with the datafiles.<br /> You can find a sample chapter from <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">Jeremy Zawodny</a> book, <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/hpmysql/index.html">High Performance MySQL</a>.</p>
