<p>Today I filled a Mozilla bug report about an old bug on handling Arabic paragraph, in the same day I received a feedback about this bug saying they couldn&#8217;t regenerate it on current versions. So I downloaded Firefox Preview Release and it really solved, I love Mozilla 🙂<br />Update: The bug still exists in Mozilla 1.7.3 🙁<br />Update: But it works with Mozilla 1.8 a 🙂</p>
