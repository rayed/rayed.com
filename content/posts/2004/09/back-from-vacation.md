<p>&#8230; so tired, I found out that I don&#8217;t relax on my vacations, from now on I need to include a relaxation period in all of my vacations.<br />One more thing, when I go back to work I really hate it, but we will see if the relaxation period will solve this.<br />About my vacation, I spent two days in Ras Tanura in Aramco compound, in my wife&#8217;s uncle home, Fahad, it was great the place is very nice with a sea view, they have very small but fun city.<br />Then I spent two days in Bahrain, nothing new their same place, same activities, we saw 5 movies and came back again &#8230; and that&#8217;s it.</p>
