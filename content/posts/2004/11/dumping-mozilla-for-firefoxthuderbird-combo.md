<p>I decide to stop using Mozilla in favour of Firefox, Thuderbird combo.<br /><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> is a stand alone browser, and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thuderbird</a> is stand alone email client, both made by Mozilla foundation.<br />I make this decision since Mozilla package isn&#8217;t as current as neither Firefox, or Thuderbird, and I think I raed that Mozilla foundation will favour Firefox/Thuderbird.<br />Another advantage of two seperate programs for browsing and email, is the ability to upgrade one component without affecting the other, althought all Mozilla upgrade were very smooth.</p>
