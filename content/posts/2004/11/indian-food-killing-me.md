<p>Couple of weeks ago a new Indian restaurant open in Raka Plaza near my home, it is called <b>&#8220;Spice&#8221;</b>, it looked nice, and the logo was really cool.<br />
Last week me and my wife tried it, the food was good, the problem was the day after that, I had the worst stomach ache, and it didn&#8217;t stop until today. Everytime I eat anything the same pain comes again.<br />

<small>They stole the logo from <a href="http://www.cafespice.com/">Cafe Spice</a>.</small></p>
