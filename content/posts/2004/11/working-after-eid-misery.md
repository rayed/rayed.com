<p>Today is the second day of work after Eid vacation, I hardly got up from my bed today, as you know sleeping hours in Ramdan and Eid is dramatically fliped, I usually sleep after 6 am!! and wake up around 2pm.<br />I went to bed at 12 am but couldn&#8217;t sleep until 5:30 am.<br />Today I&#8217;ll try to stay awake all day, so I can fall sleep early in night.</p>
