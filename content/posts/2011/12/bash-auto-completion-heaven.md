<blockquote><p>bash completion extends bash&#8217;s standard completion behavior to achieve complex command lines with just a few keystrokes.  This project was conceived to produce programmable completion routines for the most common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the amount of typing sysadmins and programmers need to do on a daily basis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just install:<br />
<code>sudo aptitude install bash-completion</code></p>
