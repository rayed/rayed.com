<p>Don&#8217;t miss the latest episode of <a href="http://twit.tv/show/floss-weekly/194">FLOSS weekly podcast</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Widenius">Monty</a> the original author of MySQL, to learn why you should consider <a href="http://mariadb.org/">Maria DB</a> instead of MySQL in your next project, some highlights from the interview:</p>
<ul>
<li>He is Finnish not Swedish!! yet another Finnish changing the world!!</li>
<li>He has 2 daughters My, and Maria, and one son Max &#8230; this where &#8220;My&#8221;SQL, &#8220;Maria&#8221;DB, &#8220;Max&#8221;DB names come from.</li>
<li>Even after selling MySQL for 1 Billion dollar to Sun, he still lives in the same neighborhood.</li>
<li>Why he created MariaDB, how he feel about MySQL under Oracle</li>
<li>Still coding, at least 4 hours a day!!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks <a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/merlyn/">Randal</a> and <a href="http://webmink.com/">Simon</a> for great interview, and thank you Monty for great product.</p>
