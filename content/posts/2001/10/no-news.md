<p>Is a good news 🙂<br />No really my life is getting very boring, long cycle of routines 🙁<br />Is that what I want to do for the rest of my life?!<br />Okay, let us take a moment to think what is wrong in the picture, first my private life (yes I do have one 🙂 I am engaged for abount three months now (this is a news isn&#8217;t it) &#8230; any way I didn&#8217;t want to tell you, don&#8217;t ask why, may be because it private, any way I already did.<br />Every thing is going ok on my private life, every thing is getting very clear, all the dates are known now, nothing in the near future yet, so I am starting to get used to the situation (Is this good or bad!!)<br />Work is another story, I don&#8217;t know what to say about it, but I really start to hate it, things take forever to finish, every aspect is improving but nothing finishes, I&#8217;ll taslk about it in the near future.</p>
