<p>Today I converted my browser from Opera to Mozilla9 .5, I was running Opera and Mozilla9 .X for the past couple of weeks, Opera is very fast but sometimes it gives poor view for some web sites, Mozilla is better in viewing web sites, but it is kind of slow, another thing I like with Opera is the tabbed view, all web sites are in the same window, and you tab to switch between them, but now Mozilla9 . 5have this feature, so I converted directly 🙂<br />I also moved my emails from Netscpe4 .X to the new Mozilla, a good thing about it, that you can use multiple email accounts 🙂<br />UPDATE: the email serach is very slow, and it doesn&#8217;t have spell-checking 🙁</p>
